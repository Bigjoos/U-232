This product had been given to you as a personal gift.
And there is a reason for the name "UniquePixels", do you have any idea? That's right 
its because this template is Unique. Your are the only one with licence to have this 
template on a running Torrent Tracker.

I believe in those people I give templates, therefore I can't control if a 3. part is 
going to get fingers in it.
But for a start I'll make Licence codes, to valid the templates. To have a complete 
valid template you need to have this file:
"yourserver.org/template/X/.licence" -  X stands for the number of your template

In template.php is there a number, the licence number witch I have a 
copy of. With that code there is a Licence URL, and that URL HAVE to match your 
website URL to be valid. You can Visit kidvision.me's forum for checking your validation 
URL. You can easy find this if your a Member+, and your are, else you diden have a chance 
for requesting a template like this

If your template is not valid please contact me licens@kidvision.me
